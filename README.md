## Mathematical and Statistical Practices with Python  

This repository is dedicated to simple practices and exercises using Python programming aimed at enhancing my skills in mathematical and statistical concepts.  

## Libraries Used  

I am practicing with the following Python libraries:  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: For data visualization.  
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing.  
- **SciPy.stats**: For statistical functions.  

## Topics Covered  

In this repository, I am focusing on key statistical concepts, including:  
- Measures of central tendency such as:  
  - Mean  
  - Median  
  - Skewness  
  - Standard Deviation
     
"and for error i want to say is it challenge for You for completing this code"

- Standard scores such as:  
  - Z-scores  
  - T-scores  

## Current Focus  

As a junior data scientist and AI enthusiast, I am currently focused on solidifying my understanding of statistical and mathematical fundamentals. My goal is to eventually delve into machine learning concepts, including decision trees, train-test splits, and more.  

I appreciate any support and feedback from others in the community as I navigate through this learning journey.   

Thank you for your support! ðŸ˜Š
